# About
This is the source code for FrutaGroove Player, the Qt rewrite of the classic version which you can find [here](https://github.com/Erizur/FrutaGroovePlayer).
The rewrite is pretty basic at the moment, with some of the functionalities and code not implemented and still being worked on.

# TODO
- Finish the initial release
- Compact mode and notifications
- Custom themes support (using Qt's Stylesheets)
- Finish the playlists system
- Fix bugs related to non-unicode characters
- Metadata and Audio Visualization (to be done in the future)
- Start an online server to host updates for the app

# Credits

# Building
Since I can't provide the libraries as-is from their original authors, follow the instalation/build instructions from these links so you can get FrutaGroove Player up and running, I only update the source files so once you get everything setup you don't have to do it again.

The project uses Qt 6 (specifically 6.2), you can get everything Qt needs using it's [installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer).
